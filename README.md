- 👋 Hi, I’m @SultanMaster
- 👀 I’m interested in developing apps that disrupt, transform and move the world and saves lives.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics, R, Python, Azure etc. I am much better at designing the software than programing it, thats why I need help. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on this project to help out Ukrainians Civilians that are fleeing the war zone
- 📫 How to reach me, always better by e-mail jonathaninit@gmail.com
